                    <li>I give each of you a private 30-minute online or telephone “empathy session” for full
                        expression, being heard and inner clarity.</li>
                    <li>These are followed by a joint session, in which I support you to be fully heard by each other,
                        gain mutual clarity, understanding and compassion. Empathic listening is used as a basis to meet
                        you both just where you are, without correcting, blaming, shaming, or solution-giving. From
                        there new agreements are found (by you) to try out and later evaluate together and revise. </li>
