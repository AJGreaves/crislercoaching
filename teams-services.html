                                        in your daily life. In addition to theory, the participants get many
                                        opportunities to practice with personal work and / or private situations. In
                                        this way skills are built up that help to have more fulfilling relationships.

                                    <p>Content: we dive into the 4 steps of the communication model:
                                        observation,
                                        feeling, need and request. We learn to distinguish between this new way of
                                        communicating and the traditional way that we have all learned since childhood.
                                        And we practice becoming aware of the 3 choices in communication:
                                        self-connection, expression, listening. We also pay attention to the function of
                                        and ways to deal with emotions such as anger, grief, fear, shame, guilt, and how
                                        we can find the underlying needs. Additional topics include dealing with: inner
                                        conflicts, conflicts with others, demands, opinions, saying no, empathic
                                        listening, giving and receiving feedback.</p>
                                    <p>Courses are not open to the public (open registration), but for existing groups
                                        and teams who interact with each other on a regular basis. I hold the strong
                                        intention to include management fully in team trainings.</p>
                                    <p>To optimize your learning progress, I recommend to spend an hour or more on
                                        weekly practices and exercises that I offer. You can do these alone or with
                                        other participants. I will set up a (voluntary) empathy buddy system, in which
                                        the learned skills of listening and expressing can be strengthened.</p>
                                    <p>No exams or grades are given during these trainings; a certificate of attendance
                                        can be provided to those who attend 85% of the sessions.</p>
                                    <p>Participants are not required to purchase any materials. If you would like to
                                        read about NVC, Marshall Rosenberg's "Nonviolent Communication: A language of
                                        life" is suggested.</p>

                                        Cara has been providing my company a subscription service, in which she tailors
                                        her coaching and facilitation support to the needs of our teams and individuals.
                                        Her approach has helped me personally think about my interactions with important
                                        people in my life. Her calm work to help me with a Nonviolent Communication
                                        style has been really impactful for me. I would like to continue to do more of
                                        this - I really feel it makes me a better colleague, parent and friend. I
                                        recommend her to other senior leaders who can struggle with stress affecting
                                        relationships.

                                        Since its inception in 2018, Cara has played an instrumental role in supporting
                                        students and staff of the Practice Held in Common Master's program at ArtEZ.
                                        Next to teaching the foundational course, Compassionate Communication, she also
                                        supports students and staff on an individual basis, mediates conflicts when they
                                        arise, and facilitates community meetings when a safe space is needed. 
                                        The program attracts a very diverse and international student body;
                                        navigating different cultural sensibilities and different levels of comfort with
                                        NVC, Cara has successfully developed an approach to teaching it in which all
                                        participants feel included, safe, and supported. It has been
                                        and is an incredible journey of discovery and growth.

                                        I am thankful for the tools, which I learned during these past two years of
                                        following Cara's Compassionate Communication classes: how to differentiate my
                                        thoughts from observations, how to get to my needs through my feelings, how to
                                        connect my mind with my body, how to find out where my different emotions are
                                        located, how to move forward when I am stuck, how check if my old belief systems
                                        are supporting or blocking me . . . when to let them go; how to be an empathic
                                        listener and give enough space for others, how to be firm with my needs and
                                        flexible with my strategies, how to give and receive appreciation. I have become
                                        much more aware of the importance of self-care and being kind to myself,
                                        welcoming all of my needs. I'm so happy that I now experience much more balance
                                        in my life.

                                        Cara's training opened me up to the strength that NVC can provide within our
                                        (XRNL) movement. It felt organic and personally I found it very therapeutic.
                                        Each concept was introduced with care and time and we were given enough space to
                                        start to work through them. A few days after the training, a conflict arose in a
                                        meeting I was facilitating. The wisdom you shared helped me find patience and
                                        attention for the needs of those involved Everyone felt listened to, and I felt
                                        that my contribution was valued by the group. I'm really looking forward to
                                        exploring this further!

                                        It was a wonderful and special day, an enormous contribution to our team. I
                                        really enjoyed the clarity you gave us and how you led the training 'from the
                                        heart.' There was a lot of depth from sharing our own experiences regarding a
                                        current situation our team is facing. I am very happy with how it went and that
                                        we will continue with Connecting Communication.
