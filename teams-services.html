                                        Cara has been providing my company a subscription service, in which she tailors
                                        her coaching and facilitation support to the needs of our teams and individuals.
                                        Her approach has helped me personally think about my interactions with important
                                        people in my life. Her calm work to help me with a Nonviolent Communication
                                        style has been really impactful for me. I would like to continue to do more of
                                        this - I really feel it makes me a better colleague, parent and friend. I
                                        recommend her to other senior leaders who can struggle with stress affecting
                                        relationships.

                                        DSA, including serving as our ombudsperson, facilitating bi-weekly “Team

                                        we focused on reflection and connection. She provides our school a wonderful

                                        have free and honest discussions on sensitive matters in a light way. She helps

                                        I am thankful for the tools, which I learned during these past two years of
                                        following Cara's Compassionate Communication classes: how to differentiate my
                                        thoughts from observations, how to get to my needs through my feelings, how to
                                        connect my mind with my body, how to find out where my different emotions are
                                        located, how to move forward when I am stuck, how check if my old belief systems
                                        are supporting or blocking me . . . when to let them go; how to be an empathic
                                        listener and give enough space for others, how to be firm with my needs and
                                        flexible with my strategies, how to give and receive appreciation. I have become
                                        much more aware of the importance of self-care and being kind to myself,
                                        welcoming all of my needs. I'm so happy that I now experience much more balance
                                        in my life.

                                        Cara's training opened me up to the strength that NVC can provide within our
                                        (XRNL) movement. It felt organic and personally I found it very therapeutic.
                                        Each concept was introduced with care and time and we were given enough space to
                                        start to work through them. A few days after the training, a conflict arose in a
                                        meeting I was facilitating. The wisdom you shared helped me find patience and
                                        attention for the needs of those involved Everyone felt listened to, and I felt
                                        that my contribution was valued by the group. I'm really looking forward to
                                        exploring this further!

                                        really enjoyed the clarity you gave us and how you led the training 'from the
                                        heart.' There was a lot of depth from sharing our own experiences regarding a
                                        current situation our team is facing. I am very happy with how it went and that
