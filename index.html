                <p>Communication shapes every part of life - at work, at home, and within ourselves. When
                    misunderstandings or conflict arise, it can be difficult to express yourself in a way that truly
                    connects.</p>
                <p>I offer <strong>personal coaching</strong> to help you 
                    communicate with while navigating life's 
                    challenges. Whether you're facing <strong>personal 
                    struggles, relationship tensions, or 
                    professional transitions</strong>, 
                    my approach provides a <strong>supportive 
                    space for self-awareness, deeper connection, 
                    and meaningful change</strong>. You'll tap into your 
                    inner wisdom and develop communication skills 
                    as you move forward with confidence and purpose.
                </p>
                <p>Based in <strong>Haarlem</strong>, I coach in <strong>English and Dutch</strong>, drawing on over 30
                    years of experience in
                    communication, leadership, and conflict resolution.</p>

                                             I recall wishing so deeply, as a kid, to live in a world without violent actions
                                            or language. As the years passed, I became more and more sad and fearful,
                                            thinking that I'd never get to see that world. I needed some real tools and some
                                            hope. Gradually learning NVC has awakened in me a type of listening that helps
                                            me hear the world I've always imagined... one where the precious contents of the
                                            human heart are the only real topics of conversation. In that light, I feel so
                                            elated and appreciative when I reflect on my very first NVC conversation with
                                            you Cara. You said many helpful things but most helpful of all... you really
                                            listened to me. I needed my honesty to be embraced. I needed to express deep
                                            pain, celebrate deep inner growth and have it all received with warmth. Thank
                                            you so much!

                                            My partner and I found Cara to be a very knowledgeable communication
                                            coach who has a way of presenting her observations and ideas in nonthreatening
                                            and insightful ways as well as reframing a discussion and drilling down to the
                                            core of an issue. In each session, she helped us cut away the clutter and see
                                            the unmet needs at the root of our problems. I am very pleased with what we were
                                            able to accomplish in our sessions with Cara. While it's obvious that learning
                                            to be better communicators is a lifetime process, it no longer appears such a
                                            daunting prospect.

                                            and gentle person. For us, she did a great job helping us to toward connection
                                            by encouraging us to look inside of ourselves to communicate our needs better,
                                            by showing us how to distinguish thoughts and feelings. She made sure both of us
                                            had a chance to speak and listen, which was an immensely difficult task given
                                            the "can't get any worse" state we were in. Seeing Cara individually was more
                                            relaxed, introspective, and stimulating. She asked me questions that encouraged
                                            me to bring attention to myself, look inside, feel, and think, which helped to
                                            clarify some things troubling me. Cara was very patient and persistent in
                                            redirecting me when I strayed from focus.

                                             Learning NVC from Cara via online sessions was a special event for me, and I am
                                            really grateful that I had chance to be part of it and super grateful for Cara
                                            for leading it. Members of the group shared our experiences in very warm and
                                            welcoming atmosphere. I noticed that after each class I felt more present, more
                                            open, connected, I felt really good inside about myself, people and life in
                                            general. I felt energized and at peace. These gatherings met my deep needs for
                                            learning, honesty and openness which was so exciting that I was sometimes
                                            running to be on time for them. Cara has taught me ways of communication that
                                            touches me deep inside. If I imagine life to be an adventurous journey of
                                            seeking meaning and joy, then NVC would be a 'magical' tool that shows a way to
                                            see the beauty in people making the journey easier and brighter.
