                    <li>Initial, free intake conversations take place online or via telephone.
                        These can be together or separate - please schedule using my <a
                            href="https://calendly.com/cara-crisler/15-minute-intake-with-cara" target="_blank"
                            rel="nofollow">online calendar</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you decide to work with me, I send you a draft agreement which lays out mutual clarity about
                        how we do that. Once we each are in agreement, we sign a final agreement.</li>
                    <li>I give each of you a private 30-minute online or telephone “empathy session” for full
                        expression, being heard and inner clarity.</li>
                    <li>These are followed by a joint session, in which I support you to be fully heard by each other,
                        gain mutual clarity, understanding and compassion. Empathic listening is used as a basis to meet
                        you both just where you are, without correcting, blaming, shaming, or solution-giving. From
                        there new agreements are found (by you) to try out and later evaluate together and revise. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Couples can schedule as many sessions as are desired. Most go for a 5-session trajectory, with a
                    discounted price.</p>
