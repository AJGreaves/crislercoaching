                        how we do that. Once we each are in agreement, we sign a final agreement.</li>
                    <li>I give each of you a private 30-minute online or telephone “empathy session” for full
                        expression, being heard and inner clarity.</li>
                    <li>These are followed by a joint session, in which I support you to be fully heard by each other,
                        gain mutual clarity, understanding and compassion. Empathic listening is used as a basis to meet
                        you both just where you are, without correcting, blaming, shaming, or solution-giving. From
                        there new agreements are found (by you) to try out and later evaluate together and revise. </li>

                <p>Couples can schedule as many sessions as are desired. Most go for a 5-session trajectory, with a
                    discounted price.</p>

                                        I recall wishing so deeply, as a kid, to live in a world without violent actions
                                        or language. As the years passed, I became more and more sad and fearful,
                                        thinking that I'd never get to see that world. I needed some real tools and some
                                        hope. Gradually learning NVC has awakened in me a type of listening that helps
                                        me hear the world I've always imagined... one where the precious contents of the
                                        human heart are the only real topics of conversation. In that light, I feel so
                                        elated and appreciative when I reflect on my very first NVC conversation with
                                        you Cara. You said many helpful things but most helpful of all... you really
                                        listened to me. I needed my honesty to be embraced. I needed to express deep
                                        pain, celebrate deep inner growth and have it all received with warmth. Thank
                                        you so much!

                                        </span>My partner and I found Cara to be a very knowledgeable communication
                                        coach who has a way of presenting her observations and ideas in nonthreatening
                                        and insightful ways as well as reframing a discussion and drilling down to the
                                        core of an issue. In each session, she helped us cut away the clutter and see
                                        the unmet needs at the root of our problems. I am very pleased with what we were
                                        able to accomplish in our sessions with Cara. While it's obvious that learning
                                        to be better communicators is a lifetime process, it no longer appears such a
                                        daunting prospect.<span class="quotemarks"> <i

                                        I found Cara to be extremely patient, understanding, compassionate, supportive
                                        and gentle person. For us, she did a great job helping us to toward connection
                                        by encouraging us to look inside of ourselves to communicate our needs better,
                                        by showing us how to distinguish thoughts and feelings. She made sure both of us
                                        had a chance to speak and listen, which was an immensely difficult task given
                                        the "can't get any worse" state we were in. Seeing Cara individually was more
                                        relaxed, introspective, and stimulating. She asked me questions that encouraged
                                        me to bring attention to myself, look inside, feel, and think, which helped to
                                        clarify some things troubling me. Cara was very patient and persistent in
                                        redirecting me when I strayed from focus.

                                        Learning NVC from Cara via online sessions was a special event for me, and I am
                                        really grateful that I had chance to be part of it and super grateful for Cara
                                        for leading it. Members of the group shared our experiences in very warm and
                                        welcoming atmosphere. I noticed that after each class I felt more present, more
                                        open, connected, I felt really good inside about myself, people and life in
                                        general. I felt energized and at peace. These gatherings met my deep needs for
                                        learning, honesty and openness which was so exciting that I was sometimes
                                        running to be on time for them. Cara has taught me ways of communication that
                                        touches me deep inside. If I imagine life to be an adventurous journey of
                                        seeking meaning and joy, then NVC would be a 'magical' tool that shows a way to
                                        see the beauty in people making the journey easier and brighter.
