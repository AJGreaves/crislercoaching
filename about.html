                    <h4>Me now</h4>
                    <p>I love supporting human beings, wishing each of us to experience
                        joy and meaning in our daily lives. Not at the expense of others,
                        but in cooperation and through mutual support. </p>

                    <p>For the past thirty years, my career has been centered on
                        supporting people. As a senior-level <a href="https://www.emccglobal.org/"
                            target="_blank"><strong>EMCC-accredited
                                coach</strong></a>,
                        I help people navigate challenges, build confidence,
                        and develop meaningful connections. My experience as
                        a <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/" target="_blank"><strong>certified Nonviolent
                                Communication trainer</strong></a> allows me
                        to create a safe, nonjudgmental space for people to explore
                        their needs, express themselves clearly, listen empathically
                        and thereby engage in transformative conversations.</p>

                    <p>I am dedicated to offering support in a sustained way.
                        I value authenticity, connection, equity and true cooperation.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
                    <p>Like many others raised in the U.S.A., I had learned to “put my best face forward,” which for me
                        meant showing the world a particular I-have-it-all-together mask. Even when (maybe especially
                        when) I most certainly did not experience life this way. By the time I was an adult, I found
                        myself living with a harsh inner critic with impossibly high standards, working hard with little
                        room for play, a practice of avoiding conflict, pleasing, being nice, and a
                        must-hide-all-unpleasantness mask that I didn't realize I was forcing myself to wear most of the
                        time.</p>

                    <p>In 2004, I was hit with a lot of insecurities. Trying to give 100% to each of my roles - mother,
                        partner, employee, colleague, daughter, friend - just didn't add up. My inner critic was
                        constantly letting me know I was failing at everything, and I was feeling terribly unsatisfied
                        and alone with my reality.</p>

                    <p>When I moved with my family of four to the Netherlands in 2010, all things familiar were gone and
                        none of my old patterns were working anymore in my favor. At some point I realized that I had
                        lost myself completely, not knowing who I really was or what I really wanted, and most of the
                        time I felt quite frustrated and lonely. My inner stress showed up in nearly all of my
                        relationships contributing to their fragility.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4 mb-4 mb-lg-0">
                    <div class="cara-pic-wrapper">
                        <div id="cara-about-pic-2"></div>
                    </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
                    <p>I rarely use labels, yet I realized one day that I was in a “good ole mid-life crisis,” and
                        that's when I knew I wanted to seek out some support to help me gently find my way out of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>I found it in many coaching and communication training sessions that primarily helped me discover
                        myself, the “real me.” I learned how to speak to myself compassionately and listen to what's
                        MOST important to me; how to stop pleasing others for belonging/connection and to rely on
                        honesty instead; to get in touch with my personal needs how to come up for them, and care for
                        myself (like finding refuge in nature) AND stay in connection with important people in my life.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>After a decade of individual and relationship coaching, I am still passionate about
                            helping others finding their way, and now also working in international team
                            settings.</strong></p>

                        Practitioner level.</h4>
                    <p>This is for me an important distinction, given that anyone can call
                        themselves a coach. It identifies me as having not only solid training, but also proven
                        experience and commitment to ongoing supervision, learning, reflection and development. </p>
                    <p>It helps
                        to guarantee safety and quality due to the standards I am required to meet and my commitment to
                        follow the <a href="https://www.emccglobal.org/leadership-development/ethics/"
                            target="_blank">Global Code of Ethics for Coaches & Mentors</a>.</p>

                        Communication Trainer</h4>
                    <p>Recognized by the <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/" target="_blank">Center
                            for Nonviolent Communication</a>, this training promotes the
                        NVC model created by Marshall B. Rosenberg on a worldwide basis.</p>
                    <p>NVC has fundamentally changed
                        not only the way in which I speak with myself, but also the way I approach people in both my
                        personal and professional life. It is one of compassion, trust and acceptance while seeking
                        clarity and deep honesty.</p>
                    <p>It helps meet my needs for well-being, honesty and connection more
                        than anything else I've encountered. I use it as a basis for my coaching and facilitation work,
                        and where desired teach NVC-themed courses.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">Most importantly, I genuinely care about authenticity, connection, equity and true
                        cooperation.
                    </h4>
                    <p>I believe this is what the world needs most right now. I love supporting others who care about
                        these life qualities.</p>
                    <p>If you do, too, let's talk and see how we can work together.</p>
